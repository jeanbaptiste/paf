				<p>This is the report of my MRes short project.<br>
Supervisors:<b>&nbsp;</b>Andy Anderson, Alan Johnston, Peter McOwan</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-900"></span>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>It has been well established that the pattern of colouration on many 
animals is adaptive and confers a survival advantage by concealment, 
from either predators or prey. The first section of this report reviews 
different general camouflaging strategies to evade visual detection. The
 second section discusses different models for explaining the mechanism 
of neural computation in the visual system. Both edge detectors and 
motion detectors are treated in detail. Section 3 examines two examples 
where the camouflage system appears to be exploiting a specific feature 
of the observer’s visual processing pathway.</p>
<p>Section 4 begins the investigation into optical illusions designed 
specifically as novel methods of masking movement. Several different 
active camouflage strategies are discussed, including minimisation of 
apparent motion, and percepts of accelerated or retarded velocity. These
 illusions are run through a programme simulating the action of the 
Multi-channel Gradient Model of motion perception to obtain an objective
 quantification of the perceptual effects. Section 5 addresses the 
question as to whether these illusions are employed in nature to disrupt
 motion perception. The common cuttlefish, along with other cephalopods,
 produces a characteristic kinetic pattern that may represent an 
adaptation to generate the motion illusions examined in this research. 
Two alternative hypotheses for the function of the display are 
discussed, both of which are novel to the best of the author’s 
knowledge.</p>
<p>Mathematica programmes were written to generate the designed motion 
illusions, graph the output from McGM simulation as radar plots, and 
also to produce several of the diagrams in this report.</p>
<p><strong>1. Aspects of Camouflage</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Cott (1940) wrote the seminal paper on animal 
camouflage and identified several combinable methods, among them 
cryptic, disruptive, mimicry and countershading. Ender (1986) defined 
five characteristic stages of predation: detection, identification, 
approach, subjugation, and consumption. Adaptations against detection 
and identification; approach; and subjugation and consumption have been 
named primary, secondary and tertiary defences, respectively.<br>
Cryptic patterning avoids detection whereas disruptive systems are often
 conspicuous but hamper identification. Confusing, shocking or deimatic 
signals, such as butterflies flashing large eye-like patterns on their 
wings, are appropriate during the predator’s approach phase, although 
are not strictly modes of camouflage. There is evidence that an animal’s
 perception of its own conspicuousness influences the decision to remain
 camouflaged or flee when a predator enters the approach phase<sup>1</sup>. Many camouflage methods are, of course, also applicable to predators aiming to avoid detection by their prey.</p>
<p>The efficacy of a camouflage scheme depends as much on the optical 
properties of the environment as the visual system of the observer. 
There exists a co-evolutionary arms race between a prey’s camouflage and
 neurophysiology of the predator’s visual pathway. If the predator 
adapts and the match becomes imperfect then the camouflage can be 
broken, and the prey is under a renewed selective pressure to evade 
detection. To give a human example, it was noted during World War Two 
that partially red-green colourblind observers were superior at spotting
 camouflaged positions. If the tank, for example, slightly contrasts 
with a forest background in the blue-yellow channel, but matches well in
 luminance and the red-green channel then it is invisible to a normal 
observer. Deuteranopiacs, however, are largely insensitive to red-green 
information so rely proportionally more on the other channels, and can 
spot the anomaly<sup>2</sup>. Two examples where the camouflaging scheme
 seems to have adapted to exploit a specific feature of the observer’s 
visual processing pathway are discussed in Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Cryptic</strong></p>
<p>Cryptic colouration renders the bearer difficult to detect by 
emulating the immediate visual background. The colouring, size, and 
distribution of pattern elements must necessarily be in aspects 
pertinent to the visual system of the observer, such as light intensity-
 or wavelength-sensitivity, or visual acuity. Ideally, the camouflage 
should represent a random sample of the background at the place and time
 of highest predation risk<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The difference in luminance between upper- and under-surfaces due to 
overhead illumination can betray camouflaged animals. This is often 
compensated for by countershading: the upper surface is coloured darker 
than the lower so that the organism appears optically flat when 
illuminated from above. In addition, if the animal is viewed from 
beneath then the pale underside merges with the sky, and from above the 
topside merges with the ground. Species of Cephalopoda, including the 
common squid, have been found to use their active camouflage to 
adaptively countershade during rolling<sup>4</sup>. Even a white 
undersurface can create a strong silhouette when viewed against a bright
 sky, and some marine species, such as the pony fish (Leiognathidea 
family), address this intensity contrast by controllably emitting 
bioluminescence from their underside<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>A good method of accurately matching the background luminance and 
colour is to be transparent, or at least translucent. This system has 
the advantage that it is background and viewing angle invariant, and 
also matches luminance to diminish silhouetting. Luminance matching can 
also be achieved with mirrored surfaces. This simple form of camouflage 
can be broken, however, by predators with polarisation-sensitive visual 
systems. The aligned fibres of muscle and reflective surfaces both 
partially linearly polarise light<sup>6</sup>,<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and 
impart a conspicuous tell-tale signature against the background. This 
can be used by predators with polarisation-sensitive visual systems, 
such as squid, octopi and cuttlefish<sup>7</sup>, to break the camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Disruptive</strong></p>
<p>Disruptive systems of camouflage merge well with the background along
 some parts of the periphery and so are inconspicuous. Other areas 
contrast highly and draw the observer’s attention to less essential 
areas of the animal’s form. Adjacent distracting marks are complex to 
give the appearance of an assembly of separate objects rather than one 
contiguous surface. This has the effect of breaking up a prey’s 
characteristic outline and so reducing the probability that it is 
recognised as an edible item. ‘Dazzle camouflage’ was adopted by Allied 
shipping during the First World War, as disruptive patterns were 
believed to hamper the estimation of a ship’s course, speed and range 
through the periscope of U-boats<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Computational Visual Processing</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This section focuses on the mammalian visual system 
as it is well studied. The principles, if not exact processes, herein 
are thought to be evolutionary conserved, however, and are likely to be 
similar between disparate species.<br>
A monolayer of photosensitive receptor cells line the retina so the 
visual field can be treated as a two-dimensional map of receptor 
activations. Many artificial models of the visual system simplify the 
situation, ignoring the blue-yellow and red-green colour channels, and 
consider only luminance (light intensity). The information content at 
the lowest level of these simulations of the visual processing pathway 
is thus an array of brightness values. The visual system is 
hierarchical, with each level performing a simple computation on the 
output passed to it from lower levels. It is also combinatorial, and 
separate information channels are combined in different ways to reveal 
particular features in the visual field. Standard mathematical 
operations such as addition, multiplication, and division are believed 
to computed at a neuronal level, and from these more complex functions 
like differentiation, integration, smoothing, and thresholding are 
constructed. Thus, a set of increasingly sophisticated detectors are 
built, which find features such as luminance gradients, edges, bars, 
object peripheries, position in 3D space, orientation, motion speed and 
direction, and so on. The components most relevant to breaking the modes
 of camouflage discussed in Section 3 are edge detectors and the 
higher-level motion detectors.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Image Operators</strong></p>
<p>An early theory of the mechanisms behind visual perception was proposed by Marr (1982)<sup>9</sup>.
 He stressed the hierarchical nature of visual processing, with the 
local changes in the intensity map, or features, firstly made explicit, 
and then the identification of larger regions and structures composed of
 these features. A series of image operators work on the output from the
 level below to progressively compute a primal sketch of the salient 
features within the visual field. Image operators, or filters, can be 
built from cells with receptive fields with both inhibitory and 
excitatory regions. For example, the odd-symmetric double-lobed filter 
shown in Figure 1 produces maximum output when it is positioned astride 
the step edge. This filter effectively calculates the local gradient, 
dI/dx (first derivative), of the intensity profile. Alternatively, a 
second derivative operator would reveal an edge where its value is zero,
 a ‘zero-crossing’, corresponding to a peak or trough in the gradient. 
The shape of such filters are even symmetric three-lobed receptive 
fields.</p>
<p>The problem is further complicated by noise, and that edges can occur
 in any orientation and appear at a range of spatial scales. An array of
 differently-orientated filters (known as a Canny detector) is needed to
 detect edges in all directions. Another solution is to use a filter 
with a single circular field. The Laplacian, or ‘del-squared’, filter is
 such a non-orientated 2nd-derivative operator, formed from the 
summation of two orthogonally orientated two-lobe filters. Local 
measures of gradient are vulnerable to noise, and so smoothing functions
 are used to average out small-scale intensity variance. The 
‘del-squared-G’ operator combines the Laplacian edge-detector with the 
smoothing properties of the Gaussian function, and is the basis of the 
Marr &amp; Hildreth model. Graphs of the Gaussian, first and second 
derivatives, and del-squared-G functions can be seen in Figure 1. Edges 
also occur at different spatial scales, from sharp steps to wide blurs 
with shallow intensity gradient. To detect an edge filters must 
therefore also be tuned to a particular size, requiring multiple filters
 from coarse to fine scale.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Contrast energy model</strong></p>
<p>The Canny and Marr &amp; Hildreth models rely on even-symmetrical 
receptive fields, which are unable to distinguish between the responses 
caused by edges and bars. An alternative theory, the contrast energy 
model, uses the output signal from similarly orientated odd [o(x)] and 
even [e(x)] filters. The energy function E(x) is defined as:</p>
<p align="center"><b>E<sup>2</sup>(x) = e<sup>2</sup>(x) + o<sup>2</sup>(x)</b></p>
<p>which is always positive, and shows a high output when o(x) or e(x) 
or both are high (i.e. analogous to an OR logic gate). The energy peak 
flags the location of a feature which can then be identified by 
inspecting the odd and even filter outputs. If e(x) has a peak the 
feature is a bar, if o(x) has a peak it is an edge. Thus ambiguity in 
filter response has been overcome.</p>
<p>Intensity variance is thus decoded into features such as edges, bars 
(two nearby edges of opposite sign), terminations and blobs, depending 
on the type of intensity change. The next stage is the recursive 
grouping of these features into associated aggregations, based on 
proximity or orientation.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Motion detectors</strong></p>
<p>Motion is a change in position within the visual field between 
successive time steps, and so can be conceptualised as a 
three-dimensional volume. Figure 2 shows the passage of a square across a
 static background in this format. If the volume is cut horizontally the
 resultant space-time plane, I(x,t), represents the traverse of a single
 row of the square over the background, as shown in&nbsp;Figure 3.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fig_2.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915" alt="Fig_2" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Fig_2.gif" height="238" width="275"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every point in this row follows the path defined by the linear equation:</p>
<p align="center"><b>x(t) = x<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+ V.t</b></p>
<p>where x0 is the initial x position, V is velocity and t is time. The faster the motion, the steeper the gradient of this path.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<b>Reichardt’s correlation model</b>, the output of two 
spatially separated receptors are multiplied (a non-linear operation). 
One of the outputs is delayed so correlation (coincident impulses) 
occurs if the moving stimulus is of a given direction and speed. This 
simple model requires many detectors tuned to different speeds, and has 
problems of aliasing and phase dependence.</p>
<p>If velocity is thought of as an orientation in space-time it can be 
measured analogously to orientation in x-y; by the ratio of temporal and
 spatial derivatives:</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dI-dx-dI-dt.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913" alt="dI-dx-dI-dt" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/dI-dx-dI-dt.gif" height="62" width="62"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the basis of gradient models of velocity coding. In regions 
of constant luminance the intensity gradient (denominator) will be zero,
 and the above equation will be ill-conditioned. One solution is to use 
multiple channels of higher derivatives (i.e. take a truncated Taylor 
expansion about the point), since the more derivatives used the lower 
the chance that all will be zero at the same time. This more robust 
measure of velocity, known as the&nbsp;<b>Multi-channel Gradient Model</b>&nbsp;(McGM), uses not one ratio but a least squares approximation (line of best fit) of the derivatives.</p>
<p>An alternative model is similar to the contrast energy mechanism of edge-detection. The&nbsp;<b>motion energy model</b>&nbsp;uses
 two sets of orientated detectors (e.g. leftwards and rightwards), each 
composed of an odd and an even filter. The leftwards energy is 
calculated by summing the squared output from the two leftwards filters,
 and conversely for the rightwards energy. The opponent energy is the 
difference between the two motion energies, which is then normalised by 
dividing by the static energy (to remove contrast sensitivity) to give 
an estimate of velocity.</p>
<p>The detection of certain stimuli cannot be modelled by the energy 
system and they are termed ‘second order’, or non-Fourier, motion. Such 
stimuli create no structure in the luminance profile and instead involve
 modulation of local contrast, spatial density, or flicker rate. They 
can be observed by humans as ascertained by psychophysical experiment. 
The McGM can detect this motion, as well as avoiding the energy model’s 
necessity for contrast normalisation and population coding.</p>
<p><strong>3. Camouflage and the Visual System</strong></p>
<p>Animal camouflage can now be reworded in terms of the visual 
processing system. Countershading minimises the intensity gradient down 
an animal, so that it is detected only be the largest scale first 
derivative filters, if at all. Silhouette masking techniques, such as 
that employed by the pony fish, minimise the contrast between self and 
surroundings to escape edge-detection.<br>
Cryptic camouflage must match the background not just in luminance, but 
also in all colour channels relevant to the predator, in order to escape
 detection by the edge or bar-sensitive receptive fields. The overall 
pattern must also correlate or the higher-level texture detectors would 
break the camouflage. Disruptive patterning on the other hand is 
deliberately partly conspicuous so that some regions stand out to the 
predator’s edge detectors. These distracting marks become grouped 
together (by the aggregation algorithms mentioned above) into a form 
that does not resemble the outline of the prey, and a predator’s 
image-matching technique fails to detect it.</p>
<p>This section will now deal with two animals that appear to have 
evolved specific adaptations, one physiological the other behavioural, 
to evade edge and motion detectors.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Deceiving edge detectors</strong></p>
<p>Osorio &amp; Srinivasan (1991)<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>&nbsp;present 
evidence that some cryptic patterning has evolved to exploit a very 
specific feature of a predator’s visual system. The Australian frog, 
Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, utilises border enhancement, with the edges 
of pigment regions sharply demarcated with adjacent narrow black and 
white bands, as seen in Figure 4. Its main predation threat is from 
snakes and birds. Frogs signal vocally so it is assumed that the primary
 function of this colouration pattern is concealment, and not high 
visibility for mate attraction. They do not serve as an aposematic 
warning as the Australian frog is non-toxic, and it is not thought to be
 a Batesian mimic as poisonous species do not possess enhanced border 
patterns. It is believed, therefore, that these markings have evolved to
 directly effect a predator’s visual system, specifically by 
super-exciting edge detectors. The high contrast contours must be 
perceptually indistinguishable from ‘natural’ step edges to the 
predator’s visual system, otherwise they would provide a distinctive 
‘prey signature’ for the snake to target. As explained above, there 
exist several models on the system of filters used for edge detection, 
and this final constraint allowed Osorio and Srinivasan<sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup>&nbsp;to deduce which is probably utilised in the snake visual system.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fig_4.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917" alt="Fig_4" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Fig_4.gif" height="277" width="305"></a></p>
<p><b>Figure 4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Australian frog showing border enhancement. Taken from Osorio and Srinivasan (1991)<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The intensity profile of the enhanced edge is compared to that of a 
natural step edge in Fig 5(a). The different detectors produce distinct 
outputs when presented with the natural step edge and enhanced contrast 
edge, as shown in Figure 5(b). Both the Canny and Marr &amp; Hildreth 
detectors respond differently to the two edges, with the enhanced 
profile producing prominent ‘secondary responses’. They are able to 
distinguish between them, and therefore can break the frog’s camouflage.
 The energy model, however, is super-excited by the enhanced edge yet 
produces no secondary responses so is unable to distinguish it from a 
natural step edge. The deception is robust over a wide range of spatial 
scales (corresponding to variance in pattern size, viewing distance, or 
predator visual acuity). Osorio and Srinivasan concluded from this that 
the snake’s visual system employs contrast energy edge detectors, 
otherwise the enhanced edge broken camouflage would be under strong 
negative selection.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Deceiving motion detectors</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Anim_1.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903" alt="Anim_1" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Anim_1.gif" height="288" width="288"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Animation 1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conspicuousness of a camouflaged object due to motion.</p>
<p>Even perfect cryptic camouflage is betrayed by movement, and many 
predators stalk extremely slowly. The visual system is very sensitive to
 motion and can aggregate features by common fate. Animation 1 shows 
this effect; the square is invisible until it starts moving. Refer back 
to&nbsp;Figure 3&nbsp;for the space-time diagram of this motion. All 
animations in this project were produced by the author in<i>Mathematica</i>. An example of the code can be found in Appendix I.</p>
<p>If motion reveals a camouflaged animal then it would be reasonable to
 expect natural selection to have developed mechanisms for reducing this
 apparency. Moving slowly to minimise optic flow does not work when 
hunting fast-moving prey.</p>
<p>Following observations of hoverfly flight paths Srinivasan (1995)<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;described a strategy for motion camouflage, which has since been demonstrated in ‘dog fighting’ male dragonflies<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>.
 If an animal is able to maintain its position on a constraint line 
linking the moving target and a distant point its image does not move 
over the target’s retina. The illusion of zero apparent motion is 
created and the pursuer can mimic a stationary object located at the 
convergence point. See Figure 6.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fig_6.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919" alt="Fig_6" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Fig_6.gif" height="346" width="363"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

pursuer (red). The pursuer is using motion camouflage to mimic a 
stationary object positioned at the point of convergence of the 
constraint lines. Diagram produced by the author.</p>
<p>The pursuer can optimise different criteria, such as minimising total
 distance flown before interception or relative speed of approach, as it
 moves along the constraint lines<sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>. Ideally the pursuer would also be camouflaged against the background surrounding the fixed point. Srinivasan<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;provided
 computationally simple algorithms to generate this behaviour with the 
sensory information and flight control thought to be within insect 
capabilities. Anderson has also shown that humans are deceived by this 
stealth strategy<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>This research project is concerned with investigating a novel stealth strategy for disguising movement.</p>
<p><strong>4. Novel motion camouflaging strategies</strong></p>
<p>As seen in Animation 1, a region of common velocity is readily 
perceived as a unit and stands out against a static background. The 
outline is stark (although the lines and angles of a square are rare in 
nature) and during motion disruptive patterning would not escape a 
predator’s search image. One method of reducing this motion cue is to 
actively alter skin pigmentation to create a pattern flowing backwards 
at the same rate as actual forward motion. The two velocities cancel out
 and the texture appears stationary. Animation 2 demonstrates this 
illusion, and the space-time diagram in Figure 7 shows the problem that 
motion detectors face.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Anim_2.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923" alt="Anim_2" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Anim_2.gif" height="288" width="288"></a></p>
<p><b>Animation 2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Active camouflaging to reduce perceived motion.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fig_7.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920" alt="Fig_7" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Fig_7.gif" height="288" width="288"></a></p>
<p><b>Figure 7.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Space-time diagram of actively camouflaged square motion</p>
<p>There is no net movement within the square region and so the 
trajectory though space-time contains only vertical stripes. There is 
thus no change in intensity over time (δI / δt = 0 ), and motion 
detectors relying on spatiotemporally-orientated receptive fields only 
see two stationary regions. Only at the boundary of the trajectory is 
there any contrast, which corresponds to the conspicuous flicker 
perceived at the leading and trailing edges. This is due to the square 
boundary occluding the background, and can be explained by adapting an 
argument from Johnston et al (1999)<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>. At arbitrary time t<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;the
 rightmost column of the square texture is adjacent to a random column 
of the background. Next time step the square advances but the texture 
recedes so that the column remains unchanged, but is now adjacent to a 
new rightmost column of texture. Thus, within the motion detector 
receptive fields over this boundary the left-hand column is temporarily 
static and the right-hand one is effectively randomised. As Figure 8 
shows, the motion detectors are still able to extract accurate velocity 
information along this occluding boundary despite the randomisation. 
Although most of the possible transitions result in no motion being 
detected, twice as many accurately identify left-to-right (positive 
values) motion as erroneous motion signals (negative values). Along a 
boundary of 100, or more, pixels these few accurate signals will give an
 overall percept of rightwards motion along the leading edge. The 
leading and trailing edges are very apparent to the McGM programme, as 
seen in Table 1, presumably due to this mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Fig_8.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921" alt="Fig_8" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Fig_8.gif" height="237" width="411"></a></p>
<p><b>Figure 8.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) As the square advances from t<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;to t<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;the
 left-hand column remains effectively static and the right-hand column 
swaps from a column of the background to the new rightmost column of the
 square texture. In this example the pixels are not in fact random, but a
 list of all eight permutations to demonstrate the output of the filters
 in all possible scenarios. (b) The simplified space- and 
time-derivative filters used to model the output of motion detectors

and black 0. (c) Responses from the two filters, and their product. A 
positive value indicates left-to-right motion, and negative

<p>The distinction between this novel mode of motion camouflage and that
 commonly discussed in terms of military application should be stressed.
 Tanks with an optically active skin would be able to constantly update 
the displayed pattern so as to maintain a match with the background. 
Cephalopods<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>, and to a limited extent flatfish 
and chameleons, are routinely observed doing this. The strategy that 
this paper proposes is using a pattern flowing with a specific rate and 
direction in order to disguise the effect of motion itself, as opposed 
to updating camouflage in response to a change in background as a 
consequence of movement.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Anim_3.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" alt="Anim_3" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Anim_3.gif" height="288" width="288"></a></p>
<p><b>Animation 3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accelerated percept</p>
<p>An alternative to disguising the velocity field created by motion is 
to accentuate it. Animation 3 displays the optical illusion generated 
when the square’s texture flows in the same direction as actual motion. 
The resultant velocity field of the square is twice that of actual 
movement, and the percept is of accelerated motion.</p>
<p>If instead the texture flows backwards faster that the square 
advances (i.e. an overcompensation for movement) then the perceived 
velocity of the square would be predicted to be reduced. This is indeed 
the observed effect, as seen in Animation 4, where the reverse flow is 
three times the rate of actual forwards motion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the direction of texture flow is orthogonal to motion
 the animation generates transient percepts of diagonal motion 
(direction deflection). The illusion is strongest if the head is tilted 
slightly. See Animation 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://lewis.dsruptiv.net/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Anim_4.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908" alt="Anim_4" src="Motion%20illusions%20&amp;%20active%20camouflaging%20-%20Lewis%20Dartnell_fichiers/Anim_4.gif" height="288" width="288"></a></p>

<p><b>Animation 5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Percept of diagonal motion produced by perpendicular flow.</p>
<p>In addition to subjective impressions of the illusory effects, these 
animations were analysed with a Visual C++ programme simulating visual 
perception using the Multi-channel Gradient Model. At each time step the
 programme calculates the velocity vector of every pixel in the frame 
using the method of ratio of higher-order intensity derivatives of the 
McGM. The vectors are displayed as two arrays, one of magnitude the 
other of direction. The vectors were also averaged over the entire 
animation, and then displayed as scaled sectors orientated in the 
appropriate direction. The programme to perform this data manipulation 
and construct the ‘radar plots’ was written by the author in&nbsp;<i>Mathematica</i>. The results of the nine analysed animations are displayed in Table 1.</p>
<p>The salient points, summarised in Table 2, are that as the rate of 
rearwards flow increases the perceived backwards velocity increases, as 
shown by both the magnitude display and radar plot (with a growing 
signal in the rearward sectors). The converse was found to be true for 
increasing forwards flow, also as expected. The simulated&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;pattern
 produces an astounding response. Even though it flows at a rate of only
 1x, the bold stripes generate a very strong percept of accelerated 
forward motion, as gauged by the intensity of the vector magnitude and 
direction plots. The radar plot is also vastly different from the 
time-averaged perceived motion vectors of the passive camouflage square,
 with prominent spikes in the fore, aft and down directions.</p>

<p><strong>5. Two novel explanations for a cuttlefish display</strong></p>
<p>Table 1 provides an objective quantification of the illusionary 
effects that were predicted before the animations were created. The 
output was from a simulation using the McGM, but presumably animal 
visual systems that operate on similar principles would also experience 
these illusions. There may, therefore, be a selective advantage to 
employing these forms of camouflage. Disrupting the calculation of 
motion has obvious survival advantages. As a secondary defence, a 
backwards kinetic pattern would give the appearance of slower escape 
than in reality, and a predator’s attack may be mis-targeted. This would
 also hold true for forwards-flow, with the added benefit that a 
pursuing predator may break off the chase if it perceives the prey to be
 escaping too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>5.1 Biological examples of active camouflage</strong></p>
<p>Several classes of animals are able to actively alter their bodily 
pigmentation. Flatfish and chameleons are examples, but cephalopods, 
including squid, octopi, and cuttlefish, have particularly sophisticated
 active camouflage systems.</p>
<p>The common cuttlefish,&nbsp;<i>Sepia officinalis</i>, has the greatest repertoire of patterns, classified into 13 broad categories<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;with
 functions including cryptic and disruptive camouflage, deimatic 
warnings, and sexual displays. Adults possess two million pigment-filled
 chromatophores in three colour classes; yellow, orange and brown, that 
are layered at increasing depth in the dermis and so overlap when 
dilated. These are combined with the iridescent colours of iridophores 
and leucophore reflecting elements that control the degree of surface 
luminance to produce an enormous diversity of colour hues and patterns<sup>17</sup>.
 Each of these cells is under direct motor neurone innervation from the 
brain and so patterns can be changed extremely precisely and swiftly (in
 under a second).</p>
<p>Given that cuttlefish can accurately emulate the substrate by 
adaptively and rapidly altering patterning it is reasonable to suggest 
that they are physiologically able to produce the Backwards 1x flowing 
pattern that would disguise motion. No observations of kinetic patterns 
similar to this have been reported, but&nbsp;<i>Sepia</i>&nbsp;do produce a display, known as “<i>Passing Cloud</i>” with very interesting properties.</p>
<p><strong>5.2&nbsp;<i>Passing Cloud</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Passing Cloud</i>&nbsp;is defined by Hanlon and Messenger (2001)<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;as a secondary anti-predator defence and described as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“A kinetic pattern, lasting only a second or two, 
characterized by broad transverse bands of chromatophore expansion 
moving rapidly forward from the posterior mantle tip across the dorsal 
body surface to the anterior tip of the arms”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the kind of kinetic pattern that this research has 
demonstrated would disrupt the accurate assessment of velocity. 
Secondary defences are initiated when the prey has already been detected
 and identified, and the predator is now in the third stage, approaching
 for attack. This is a time a time when maintaining crypsis would be of 
limited value. Hanlon and Messenger (2001)<sup>17</sup>attribute the 
pattern only as a “rapid colour change that confuses the predator”, but a
 more specific function may be to generate the illusion of a greater 
rate of escape. The thick, high contrast stripes are very conspicuous 
and would elicit a maximal response from orientated space-time filters. 
The perceptual effects of this pattern were investigated by testing a 
simulation of it with the McGM programme. The square’s random texture 
was replaced with high contrast stripes of thickness and spatial 
frequency (three per length) similar to the photograph in Figure 9, and 
the background was replaced with a pattern characteristic of the sea 
bottom. No data could be obtained on the temporal frequency (flow rate) 
of the pattern, so for the sake of experimentation it was set to 1x. 
Animation 6 shows the simulation, and the McGM output can be seen 
in&nbsp;Table 1.</p>

<p><b>Animation 6.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Simulation of&nbsp;<i>Passing Cloud</i>pattern</p>
<p>The pattern does indeed induce an extreme perception of speed (high 
magnitude vectors directed mainly to the right) even though it is 
flowing at only 1x actual movement.</p>
<p>Cuttlefish are epibenthic and so spend the majority of the time being
 viewed from above. This perspective and their flattened bodies provides
 ideal conditions for the dorsal area to act as a display surface. The 
impact of kinetic patterns is aspect-dependent, but the cuttlefish’s 
lifestyle largely constrains the range of viewing angles.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 A second possible explanation of&nbsp;<i>Passing Cloud</i></strong></p>
<p>Boycott (1958)<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;also describes the&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;pattern, but when the cuttlefish is approaching prey before shooting out its tentacles to capture. A video&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cephbase.utmb.edu/viddb/vidsrch3.cfm?ID=37&amp;CephID" target="_blank">available online&nbsp;</a>shows a stationary octopus flashing the&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;display
 just before it lunges at a prey. It is evident that this pattern may 
serve a function before the onset of motion. An alternative proposal, 
that again, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been suggested, is 
that&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;is used to generate a motion after effect (MAE) in the observer’s visual system.</p>
<p>When fixation is transferred to a stationary pattern after observing a
 moving stimulus, such as a waterfall, illusory motion is perceived in 
the direction opposite the adapting motion – the motion after effect. 
The adapting stimulus is believed to cause fatigue in cells sensitive to
 it, which remain suppressed for some time afterwards, and thus cause a 
lingering perceptual repulsion effect<sup>19</sup>. This MAE is known to
 disrupt the assessment of speed and direction in subsequent moving 
stimuli, especially incoherent motion, as well as impairing the ability 
to detect low contrast stimuli<sup>19</sup>. These details are 
enormously important during an escape or predatory strike, and so 
denying the observer this information has undeniable survival benefit. 
On the basis of the occurrence and form of the&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;kinetic pattern it is a justifiable supposition that it functions to generate a MAE.</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusion and Future direction</strong></p>
<p>The importance of a camouflage system matching the optical background
 is well known, but the interaction with the visual processing pathway 
of the observer is often overlooked. Two examples where natural 
selection has seemingly designed the mode of camouflage to exploit a 
specific feature of the visual system were discussed. Original optical 
illusions were developed, and their potential application to motion 
camouflage examined. A well characterised cephalopod kinetic pattern, 
the Passing Cloud display, can now be viewed in terms of these 
illusions, and two novel conjectures as to the mode of functioning were 
given. The display’s simulated effect on a model visual system agreed 
well with predictions based on its function as a method of generating 
accelerated perceived motion.</p>
<p>Further research into the&nbsp;<i><i>Passing Cloud</i></i>&nbsp;pattern
 could more rigorously test the accelerated motion or MAE hypotheses. 
The McGM programme would be used to test different patterns and rates of
 flow to assess which generates the maximum percept of accelerated 
motion. Close similarity between this optimum display and the bold 
stripes of&nbsp;<i>Passing Cloud</i>&nbsp;would support my hypothesis.</p>
<p>Future research could also take a more psychological direction. 
Humans perceive the square as an object with enhanced or retarded 
velocity. Stimuli with areas of the square moving with different rates 
and directions could also be examined. For instance, would a square with
 the top half generating accelerated motion and the bottom half retarded
 motion result in an overall percept of rotation? Motion 
compartmentalisation of the square on a finer scale might generate an 
effect analogous to disruptive camouflage, where even the outline 
becomes indistinct and unrecognisable as a square. The more rigorous, 
yet time-consuming, methods of psychophysical experimentation should be 
performed on multiple volunteers that quantitatively score the percept.</p>
<p>A more extensive literature review of animals with active camouflage 
capabilities that may employ motion illusions would also be very 
informative.</p>
